Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.It currently offers 19 agents to choose from [Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>]</p>
